# Command-T

## This repo.

**NOTE:** This is a set of patches off of https://github.com/wincent/command-t but it doesn't appear that upstream is interested in the patches so I am leaving them here. Don't expect a high level of maintenance but you are free to use this repo.

## Added Features

Most of the added features are for working in a large repository everyday. I have added an option to load paths using any command (or shell pipeline) so that you can control exactly what files to list as well as allowing you to use the fastest tool you have available. I have also improved performance considerably (both loading and searching).
